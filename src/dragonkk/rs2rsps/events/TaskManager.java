/**
 * A facility for threads to schedule tasks for future execution in a background
 * thread. Tasks may be scheduled for one-time execution, or for repeated
 * execution at regular intervals.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Corresponding to each <tt>Timer</tt> object is a single background thread
 * that is used to execute all of the timer's tasks, sequentially. Timer tasks
 * should complete quickly. If a timer task takes excessive time to complete, it
 * "hogs" the timer's task execution thread. This can, in turn, delay the
 * execution of subsequent tasks, which may "bunch up" and execute in rapid
 * succession when (and if) the offending task finally completes.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * After the last live reference to a <tt>Timer</tt> object goes away <i>and</i>
 * all outstanding tasks have completed execution, the timer's task execution
 * thread terminates gracefully (and becomes subject to garbage collection).
 * However, this can take arbitrarily long to occur. By default, the task
 * execution thread does not run as a <i>daemon thread</i>, so it is capable of
 * keeping an application from terminating. If a caller wants to terminate a
 * timer's task execution thread rapidly, the caller should invoke the timer's
 * <tt>cancel</tt> method.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * If the timer's task execution thread terminates unexpectedly, for example,
 * because its <tt>stop</tt> method is invoked, any further attempt to schedule
 * a task on the timer will result in an <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>, as if
 * the timer's <tt>cancel</tt> method had been invoked.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * This class is thread-safe: multiple threads can share a single <tt>Timer</tt>
 * object without the need for external synchronization.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * This class does <i>not</i> offer real-time guarantees: it schedules tasks
 * using the <tt>Object.wait(long)</tt> method.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Java 5.0 introduced the {@code java.util.concurrent} package and one of the
 * concurrency utilities therein is the
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor
 * ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} which is a thread pool for repeatedly executing
 * tasks at a given rate or delay. It is effectively a more versatile
 * replacement for the {@code Timer}/{@code TimerTask} combination, as it allows
 * multiple service threads, accepts various time units, and doesn't require
 * subclassing {@code TimerTask} (just implement {@code Runnable}). Configuring
 * {@code ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} with one thread makes it equivalent to
 * {@code Timer}.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: This class scales to large numbers of concurrently
 * scheduled tasks (thousands should present no problem). Internally, it uses a
 * binary heap to represent its task queue, so the cost to schedule a task is
 * O(log n), where n is the number of concurrently scheduled tasks.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: All constructors start a timer thread.
